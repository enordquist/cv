This is my CV. I started out in an Overleaf template called Clean CV.

Now I just compile it locally when I make a small update. It took a few steps to get to that point:

epspdf: tool used to generate the pdf version of my computational chemistry glyph, with the name latexmk required
needed to install some extra libraries on top of texlive, namely texlive-bibtex-extras and texlive-fonts-extra

using latexmk, which is the same as Overleaf currently. see here: https://www.overleaf.com/learn/how-to/How_does_Overleaf_compile_my_project%3F

the command to compile:
  latexmk -pdf

May need to rerun biber enordquist_cv
