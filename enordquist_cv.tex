% You can use any of the icons listed in the fontawesome5 package documentation (https://ctan.math.utah.edu/ctan/tex-archive/fonts/fontawesome5/doc/fontawesome5.pdf)
% If you need to specify a specific style (as is done here for the address card), you should use the two-argument \faCenterCycle command

% The datetabular environment takes one argument, which is the width of the left date column. As seen here:
%   9em is a good choice for "dual-date" formats (e.g. Sep 2015 - Nov 2019).
%   4em is a good choice for month/year dates (Sep 2014).
%   2em is a good choice for year-only dates (as seen in the publications)
\begin{datetabular}{6em}
% This is just a tabular environment, for the most part. The dateentry command has been defined for
% convienence. It takes two arguments, the first is the date and the second is whatever you wish placed to the right.

% There is something seriously funky happening between the tabular commands and the end of the itemize blocks.
% The command \eatvspace should be used if extra space appears at the end of a datetabular environment.
